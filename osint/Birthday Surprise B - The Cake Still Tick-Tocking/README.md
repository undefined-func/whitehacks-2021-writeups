# Birthday Surprise B - The Cake Still Tick-Tocking
### TEAM NAME: NYCP

## CATEGORY
OSINT

## DESCRIPTION
Now that we found out when is his birthday, we need to find out his favourite cake! He might have other social media. Not really sure though, he never mentioned it to me. The only thing I know is that he said he often vlogged somewhere.

## FLAG
`WH2021{Ch0c0_L4V4_1s_b3$t}`

## WRITEUP
Since the challenge description has a mention of vlogging, we can infer that the challenge title is referring to TikTok.

Since most people use the same handle across all their social media accounts, we try to search for `@andrewybh1997` in TikTok. This yields 1 user with a video of a chocolate cake. The cake suggests that we have found the correct account that belongs to Andrew Yeoh Boon How.

The flag is in the video:
